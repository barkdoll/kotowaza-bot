## Credits
Thank you to [**Alex Yatskov** (FooSoft)](https://github.com/FooSoft) for his awesome work on rescuing the world from the horror of the EPWING format. Your work on [ZeroEPWING](https://github.com/FooSoft/zero-epwing) and [Yomichan Import](https://github.com/FooSoft/yomichan-import) allowed me to funnel the proverbs into JSON format for this app.

Thank you to [**Daniel Shiffman**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Shiffman) and his [awesome tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6atTSxoRiVnSuOn6JHnq2yV) on the [Coding Train YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman). I definitely could not have put this together without your great instructional videos and explanations.

Lastly, thank you to **Matt Popovich** for his awesome and easy-to-follow [Node.js twitter-bot tutorial](https://medium.com/@mattpopovich/how-to-build-and-deploy-a-simple-twitter-bot-super-fast-with-node-js-and-heroku-7b322dbb5dd3). Reading through it, I was able to implement node-twitterbot for simpler and more readable code. It also helped me deploy to Heroku securely.

Of course I am also grateful for the all the people responsible for Node, npm, Heroku, GitHub, etc., but everyone knows you guys are awesome already so let's not be redundant ;)
