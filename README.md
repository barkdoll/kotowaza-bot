## Credits
Thank you to [Alex Yatskov (FooSoft)](https://github.com/FooSoft) for his awesome work on rescuing the world from the horror of the EPWING format. Your work on [ZeroEPWING](https://github.com/FooSoft/zero-epwing) and [Yomichan Import](https://github.com/FooSoft/yomichan-import) allowed me to funnel the proverbs into JSON format for this app.

Thank you to [Daniel Shiffman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Shiffman) and his [awesome tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6atTSxoRiVnSuOn6JHnq2yV) on the [Coding Train YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman). I definitely could not have put this together without your great instructional videos and explanations.
